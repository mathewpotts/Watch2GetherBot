# Watch2GetherBot

## Author
Mathew Potts aka SirPottsalot

## Description
Discord Bot that posts a new Watch2Gether Link every 36 hours (lifetime of a temp Watch2Gether room). Uses a Replit web server in combination with UptimeRobot to keep the web server online indefinately. This isn't entirely true since there is a few minutes every day when Replit restarts the bot. To compensation for this when the bot starts it checks the last time it posted the Watch2Gether link was posted and posts it 36 hours after the last one.

## Commands
