# Watch2GetherBot

## Author

## Description
Discord Bot that posts a new Watch2Gether Link every 36 hours (lifetime of a temp Watch2Gether room). Uses a Replit web server in combination with UptimeRobot to keep the web server online indefinately. This isn't entirely true since there is a few minutes every day when Replit restarts the bot. To compensation for this when the bot starts it checks the last time it posted the Watch2Gether link was posted and posts it 36 hours after the last one.

## Commands
- !w2g
- !queue
- !add

## Troubleshooting

### Solved by '''kill 1''' in the replitâ€™s shell tab to destroy the current container and switch to a new one. This will re-install discord.
  File "main.py", line 181, in <module>
    bot.run(TOKEN)
